The project asked to create an accessible website advertising ourselves as an IT Accessibility Consultant.

During the website's development we were tasked with the following:
* Make the website readable through CSS.
* Use ARIA to help relay information to screen readers.
* Implement Responsive Web Design in order to have the layout of the website readable through different sized devices.
